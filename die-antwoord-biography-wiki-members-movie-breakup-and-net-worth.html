The group that is made of Ninja and Yolandi has been releasing high-quality music that has earned the duo fame, acceptance, and love across the world. Their unique style and boldness are captivating. Everyone should listen to Die Antwoord’s music.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6b3bdeddca63a426.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Die Antwoord </a>is a music group that released its debut hip bop album in 2009. Ninja and Yolandi Visser are the members of the group, and their group name means <i>The answer</i> in Afrikaans.</p><h2>Ninja Die Antwoord</h2><p class=align-left>Ninja Die Antwoord was born as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Watkin Tudor Jones</a> on the 26th of September 1974. He is a 44-year-old actor, music video director, rapper, record producer, and songwriter. Before forming Antwoord, he was the lead vocalist in the band Max Normal that released an album in 2001. The band broke up, and he went on to establish The Constructus Corporation that also broke up in 2003. He later revamped Max Normal to MaxNormal.TV, a Hip Hop group. In 2008, he and Yolandi formed Die Antwoord.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Lady Zamar biography: age, albums, songs, family and husband</p><h2>Yolandi Die Antwoord</h2><p class=align-left>The female vocalist of the group is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yolandi Visser</a>. She was born on the 1st of December, 1984 in Port Alfred, South Africa, and she was named Anri du Toit. Die Antwoord Yolandi was raised together with her older brother. Both she and the brother were adopted children of a church minister and his wife. At the age of five, she studied at the all-girls school known as St. Dominic’s Catholic School. She furthered her education at the Lady Grey Arts Academy. She is a 34-year-old rapper, actress, songwriter and music video director. Yolandi Visser before Die Antwoord was a member of The Constructus Corporation and MaxNormal.TV.</p><h2>Zef music</h2><p class=align-left>Ninja Die Antwoord and Yolandi are avid supporters and followers of Zef. What does it mean <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to be Zef</a>? Zef refers to a counterculture interest group. In their Zef music, the duo combines different cultures. Zef is, therefore, an amalgamation of modern music and outdated culture. In this movement, one looks stylish, fancy and sexy even if they are not wealthy in reality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b29a4fe1a11d4a88.jpg><h2>Career path</h2><p class=align-left>2009 was the year that Ninja and Yolandi began their musical journey after the release of the first album $O$ that was availed free online. The single Enter the Ninja made the album a success. The video of the song was on YouTube for nine months before it became famous. The song that features Leon Botha gained so much viewership that the servers crashed. The group then moved their official website to an American server that could handle the traffic. The group was later signed with Interscope Records after releasing this album. In April of the following year, the group toured Europe and gave electrifying performances.</p><p class=align-left>The working contract with Interscope Records came to a halt when the group established its label, Zef Records. Zef records produced the second album, Ten$ion in 2012 and the third album, Donker Mag, in 2014. Ninja and Yolandi released Mount Ninji and da Nice Time Kid, their fourth album in 2016. There is a characteristic interplay in their Zef Songs between Ninja’s swagger and the high-pitched parts by Yolandi.</p><p class=align-left>The uniqueness of the group’s art has incited curiosity. On several occasions, American journalists questioned whether their art was a hoax. Ninja asserted that he was not playing any character and that he is a superman who does not remove his suit. He further said that Antwoord’s music is a shock machine that wakes up the sleeping people. The duo’s music is futuristic and exciting, and the lyrics are usually in Afrikaans, English and Xhosa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/df93affbaae0c9de.jpg><h2>Die Antwoord last album</h2><p class=align-left>At the beginning of 2017, the duo announced that it would be releasing the fifth and final studio album. This album was released later under the title House of Zef. In May 2017, Love Drug, the first single from House of Zef was released. Why did Die Antwoord break up? Yolandi and Ninja had a plan of releasing a maximum of five albums before breaking up to pursue other ventures. Although they will not be releasing another album, they are still working together especially in tours and concerts. They are also in the process of releasing the final video. On the 3rd of May 2019, the duo released the second single, DntTakeMe4aPoes. The song features G-BOY. The complete album will be featuring several upcoming rappers from South Africa. They have a 2019 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">House of Zef Tour</a> of America lined up soon.</p><h2>Die Antwoord short film</h2><p class=align-left>Yolandi and Ninja are talented in acting. They have a short film, Umshini Wam, which is a story of Die Antwoord and its growth over the years. This film that is available online incorporates plenty of Zef slang words. In 2012, they were the faces of the T range by Alexander Wang. They also featured in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2015 film Chappie</a> by Neil Blomkamp. In the movie, they play the characters of Yolandi and Ninja who are the gangster parents of Chappie.</p><h2>Controversies</h2><p class=align-left>Before the official release of Ten$ion, the group released a teaser video. It featured a person who resembled Jane Alexander in The Butcher Boys. A copyright issue was brought up leasing to the removal of their video from all online platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/d3f7f2b80510904c.png><h2>Romantic relationship</h2><p class=align-left>As Ninja and Yolandi worked together, they grew closer and started a romantic relationship. Out of this relationship, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yolandi Visser daughter</a>, Sixteen Jones was born in 2006. The Die Antwoord daughter is now 13 years old. Are Die Antwoord married?
