The Bosnian War was an international war that occurred within Bosnia as well as Herzegovina from April 1992 until December 1995.&nbsp;It was a war fought by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) following pressure from the public was prompted to join the Bosnian War after allegations of violence against civilians had been reported by various media outlets.&nbsp;NATO military involvement mostly involved the enforcement of the “No Fly Zone” code known as Operation Deny Flight to discourage military aircraft from Bosnian and Serb Armed Forces from attacking Bosnian civilians as well as Bosniak as well as Croat forces.&nbsp;As part of the action, two F-16s belonging to the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy was scouting the skies over Bosnia on June 2nd the 2nd of June, 1995.</p><p>The 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines, starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, is loosely based on this event. Although O’Grady had given the film a positive rating on the film review television show Hot Or Not, O’Grady took offense at the portrayal of ‘his’ character in Behind Enemy Lines “as a pilot who disobeys orders and swears”. O’Grady sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for falsely misleading the public that the film was true to life and for using him unauthorized to promote the film without his permission. He also took action over the documentary, Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O’Grady Story, which was a re-edited version of a BBC documentary which Discovery Communications, parent company of the Discovery Channel, had purchased and edited. The documentary was broadcast several times on the Discovery Channel, and O’Grady accused Fox of using it to promote the film. Both suits were settled in 2004. Fox made a confidential settlement with O’Grady, while a Texas court ruled against O’Grady and in favor of Discovery Communications. The judge’s ruling stated, in effect, that the events in a person’s life are not the same thing as that person’s likeness or image.</p><p>In September 2011, O’Grady announced a run for the 2012 Republican nomination for Texas State Senate District 8, held at the time by the retiring Republican Florence Shapiro, but he later suspended his campaign because of uncertainties over the Texas redistricting fight.</p><p align=justify>On the 11th of August in 1995 the USAF RQ-1 Predator drone was destroyed by Serb forces operating in the same region.&nbsp;The Serbs were able to recover the remains and turned it over to Russia to be evaluated on a technical level.&nbsp;On August 30th, NATO began Operation Deliberate Force, a massive airstrike that ultimately lifted the siege on Sarajevo and resulted in the conclusion of the conflict in Bosnia.</p><p align=justify>O’Grady is a native of Brooklyn, New York City He is the child of William P. O’Grady and Mary Lou Scardapane. The couple attended Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Washington.&nbsp;He was a former student of the Civil Air Patrol and a 1989 Air Force ROTC graduate from the campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Universities located in Prescott, Arizona.&nbsp;Following the rescue mission, O’Grady was transferred out of active duties in the main U.S. Air Force to the Air Force Reserve, where his duties continued with the F-16.&nbsp;Then, in May of 2007, he graduated with an advanced education in the study of biblical literature at Dallas Theological Seminary located in Dallas, Texas.&nbsp;He resides in Frisco in Collin County, Texas.</p><p align=justify>O’Grady is an active Republican, having spoken at the 1996 Republican convention in support of Bob Dole. In 2004, O’Grady, supporting George W. Bush for re-election, accused Bush’s opponent John Kerry of “treason” for actions taken during the Vietnam War. O’Grady endorsed Brian Birdwell in his successful 2010 bid for the Texas State Senate, then launched his own candidacy for the Texas state house in September 2011, seeking the 2012 Republican nomination in Senate District 8 following the retirement of Sen. Florence Shapiro. O’Grady dropped out of the race in early 2012, claiming Shapiro had reneged on a promise to support him in the Republican primary, while his opponent had numerous endorsements.</p><h2>Scott O'Grady Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Scott is one of the <strong>richest Military Officer</strong> from United States.
