However, he has been a married man for most of his time in the spotlight. The marriage between T-Pain and Amber has endured for 20 years now and the couple keeps loving each other better. They were rumored to be in an open relationship but it turned out they only engage in threesomes sometimes.</p><h2><strong>T-Pain and Amber Najm Got Married in 2003</strong></h2><p>The couple didn’t date for long before they got engaged and subsequently tied the nuptial knot the next year, in 2003. Their wedding took place on September 11, 2003, and while Amber was 22, T-Pain was barely 19 years old at the time. The age gap must have raised eyebrows from family and friends but it didn’t stop the duo from growing their love for each other.</p><p>Their love has stood the test of time and their marriage has lasted for 20 years now and counting. Their years together have hardly been a bed of roses, but they always stood by each other through thick and thin. T-Pain and his wife, Amber, have only great things to say about each other on social media.</p><p>T-Pain still has the paper where Amber wrote her number for him the first time they met. He shared it on social media to commemorate their 18th anniversary and promised to be with her forever while thanking her for sticking with him. In a tribute he shared about his wife in 2019, T-Pain described her as the reason he is still alive. He went on to say she helped him stand on his feet once again when he was at his lowest.</p><p>According to the singer, his goal in life is to make his wife happy. He also shared that the secret of their long-lasting marriage is the way they try to listen to each other all the time. They make efforts to see things from each other’s perspective instead of claiming right all the time. The marriage has not been without challenges, but they have always been able to make it through each one and keep moving.</p><h2><strong>How Long Have T-Pain and His Wife Been Together?</strong></h2><p>T-Pain and his wife, Amber, have been together since December 2002, but they didn’t get married immediately. They met when Amber was serving in the United States Air Force and T-Pain, at the time, was still at the budding stage of his career. Amber was stationed at an Air Force base in Panama City at the time they met in 2002. They ran into each other and exchanged contact. Dating commenced between them in earnest afterward.</p><p>One interesting thing about their relationship is the age gap between them. While Amber was born on April 13, 1981, her husband, T-Pain was born on September 30, 1984. In fact, T-Pain was barely 18 when they started dating, but this did nothing to change the way they feel about each other. Being the older partner didn’t make Amber go all bossy on her husband. She has shown nothing but love and respect for the man she married.</p><h3><strong>Infidelity Woes Have Troubled Their Union</strong></h3><p>While they seem like the perfect duo, T-Pain and Amber have had their dark times as a couple. The singer has admitted that he used to get carried away by the attention that comes with fame and would often venture into fun with other women. This lifestyle even led to the birth of a child with a rapper named Elisa Hood. Further details about the child he fathered outside his marriage have been mostly kept off the media space.</p><p>During these trying times, Amber stood by him. She may have thought of resorting to divorce but she showered him with love and understanding instead. This proof of love endeared her more to T-Pain who has now vowed to make her happy. He has also cut out that part of him that neglects his home because of people who love him for the fame. There are many celebrity couples who have gone through cheating scandals, but it only takes the strongest with the most supportive partners to come out of it and still be together.</p><h3><strong>They Engage in Threesome</strong></h3><p>Rumors about an open marriage between T-Pain and AMber have trailed their union but according to the singer, this is not true. Instead, he admitted to welcoming a third party in their marriage oftentimes.</p><p>According to T-Pain, the idea came from his wife and she gets to make most of the choices about who they engage in sex with. Speaking on the Breakfast Club in 2019, T-Pain disclosed that they started the threesome experiment in 2019 and it was all Amber’s idea. They were at a strip club when Amber pointed out a lady she liked and after much scrutiny, they invited her home.</p><p>The Breakfast Club interview led to rumors that T-Pain and his wife were in an open relationship. The singer publicly <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">debunked the claims</a>, saying he would not try such with his girlfriend not to mention his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/T-Pains-children.jpg><h2><strong>T-Pain and Amber Najm Have Three Children</strong></h2><p>The marriage of 20 years has produced three children, one daughter, Lyriq, and two sons Muziq and Kaydnz Kodah. Their first child, Lyriq, was born in 2004, a year after their marriage commenced. When Lyriq joined the family, T-Pain was still at the budding stage of his career, but he was able to provide her basic need.</p><p>Their second child is Muziq Najim who was born in 2007. By the time they welcomed their second child, T-Pain was fast becoming a world-class singer with two albums to his credit. One of his albums also topped the Billboard 200. This means he was able to afford a cozy luxurious life for his second child.</p><p>T-pain and Amber welcomed their last child, a son named Kadynz Kodah, in May 2010. Though they now live in luxury, the singer once lost all his money to the point of borrowing money to buy a burger. However, things are looking bright for the family at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmnZ2klratv4yamaitpGLBbrzAoqWsZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZq%2BZm7Jurc2dZKShlKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./diddy-lori-and-steve-harvey-s-dinner-together-in-italy-was-planned-source-says.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diddy, Lori And Steve Harveys Dinner Together In Italy Was Planned, Source Says">&larr;
