She was born in Cebu, Philippines and is the daughter of Marites Kuhn. Her father's name is a mystery – she hardly talks about him on social media or her podcasts. Nonetheless, she was raised by all her parents, who moved to the US shortly after she was born. Apart from this, there is little information about Khalyla Kuhn's parents and childhood experience.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p class=align-left>Khalyla has one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">known sibling</a>, a sister, whose name is Julianna Kuhn. However, unlike her, she does not seem to enjoy being in the limelight. Some sources have also argued that she has three siblings, and one of them has been identified as Khawinda.</p><p class=align-left>It is in the public domain that she attended Cebu International School. After graduating <a href=#>high school</a>, she pursued Biochemistry.</p><h3>How old is Khalyla from TigerBelly?</h3><p class=align-left>Khalyla Kuhn's age is 37 years as of June 2022. She was born on 31 October 1984, and her zodiac sign is Scorpio.</p><h3>What does Khalyla Kuhn do?</h3><p class=align-left>Soon after graduating, Kuhn became a tutor. She taught anatomy, physiology, and microbiology. So, why is Khalyla Kuhn famous? In 2016, she ventured into the <a href=#>world</a> of digital content creation after she began co-hosting the <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TigerBelly Podcast</a></i> alongside her celebrity husband.</p><p class=align-left>The podcast is available on YouTube, iTunes, Audible, and Spotify. On YouTube, the channel has over 718 thousand subscribers at the time of writing, and some of the famous guests on the podcast include Jordan Peele, Eric Stonestreet, and Bert Kreischer.</p><p class=align-left>She also co-hosts another podcast called <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Trash Tuesday</a></i>. Additionally, she has a <a href=#>considerable following</a> on social media.</p><h3>What is Khalyla Kuhn's net worth?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b8fcafc88a96aa00.png><p class=align-left>Bobby Lee’s wife is a diligent lady. She has made impressive progress in her career since she shot into the limelight and has since utilised her fame to make a decent earning. According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Affair Post</a></i>, she allegedly has a net worth of $1 million.</p><h3>Bobby Lee and Khalyla Kuhn's relationship</h3><p class=align-left>The couple met in 2013 through a <a href=#>dating platform</a> known as Tinder. Afterwards, they arranged for a date, which took place at a coffee shop in Long Beach, California. At the time, Kuhn was living in California.</p><h4><strong>Did Bobby and Khalyla get married?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Yes. The two reportedly tied the knot in August 2016 in New York. But, unlike most celebrity marriages, their wedding was not publicised. So, it came as a surprise for Bobby’s fans considering that Khalyla was not as famous as him; she was just an ordinary girl.</p><h4><strong>How long have Bobby Lee and Khalyla been together?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>They once revealed that they started dating in 2013. In other words, the couple has been together for around nine years.</p><h4><strong>Are Bobby Lee and Khalyla still together?</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1acb6f4d771761bb.png><p class=align-left>Over the recent few months, there have been several speculations about the two calling it quits. However, no one has come publicly to deny or authenticate the rumours. The speculations started when Khalyla <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared a picture </a>on her Instagram page carrying a guy named Carlos, something she does with Bobby now and then. The caption of the picture reads,</p>It’s Carlos’ birthday so I’ll be carrying him in my kangaroo pouch all day.<p class=align-left>She last shared Bobby's picture on her page in January 2022. However, a few weeks ago, Bobby shared a picture of them <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on his Instagram</a> account. Therefore, assuming they are an item is safe until one party comments on the issue.</p><h3>Khalyla Kuhn's height and weight</h3><p class=align-left>Bobby Lee’s wife is around 5 feet 6 inches (167 centimetres) tall. On the other hand, she weighs 121 pounds, roughly 55 kilograms.</p><p class=align-left>Khalyla Kuhn is a diligent podcaster and social media personality. Since joining her husband in the digital content creation <a href=#>business</a>, she has gained a considerable following on social media. However, most people still recognise her as Bobby Lee’s wife.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Ronnie Coleman's net worth, age, family, health, injury, measurements, profiles, net worth</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>We</a> published an article about <a href=#>Ronnie Coleman</a>.
