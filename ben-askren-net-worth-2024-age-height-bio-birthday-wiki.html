The 2013 Bellator Welterweight Champion is also a professional wrestler also a disc golfer.</p><p>He was tied with&nbsp;He tied <a href=#>Michael Chandler</a> for a record of 8 consecutive Bellator Fighting Championship victories.&nbsp;for the record for consecutive wins of 8 Bellator Fighting Championship victories.</p><p>In college, he wrestled in the 174&nbsp;lb. weight class. He lost the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship match to Chris Pendleton in both 2004 and 2005 before winning it in 2006 and 2007. He is known for his pinning ability (he holds the single-season NCAA pin record); his massive afro; and his “funky”, or unorthodox, wrestling style. For example, while being ridden in the 2005 championship match, he attempted to reach around and apply a headlock to Pendleton, a move that any wrestling coach would disavow. His tall, lanky body — in sharp contrast to the squat, muscular physiques of many top wrestlers — allows him to attempt moves that most wrestlers could not. This characteristic later led to a challenging transition to freestyle wrestling early in his career, as the freestyle rules differ from folkstyle wrestling and penalize a wrestler for exposing his back. His younger brother Max also wrestled for Missouri and won a national championship in 2010.</p><p>Askren had a dominant Junior season in 2005–06, winning all 45 of his matches and pinning in 25 of them. He won the 174 pound weight class easily at both the Big 12 and NCAA Championships. He won his Big 12 finals match 17–6 over Jacob Klein of Nebraska and his NCAA finals match 14–2 over future two time NCAA champion, Dan Hodge Trophy winner, and World silver medalist Jake Herbert of Northwestern. Herbert was also undefeated going into the NCAA finals. Askren’s season earned him the Outstanding Wrestler award at the NCAA Championships as well as the Dan Hodge Trophy and the Rev Wrestler of the Year.</p><p align=justify>He was wed with Amy Askren in 2010.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ben Askren</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ben</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Askren</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mma Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cedar Rapids</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iowa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amy Askren</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ben Askren ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
