The super humble vocalist has always captivated fans with her down-to-earth nature, but somehow the drama just keeps following the<i>Woza</i> hitmaker. From daddy drama to messy splits, Briefly News takes a closer look.</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>New feature:</strong> <i>Check out news exactly <strong>for YOU</strong> ➡️ find “Recommended for you” block and enjoy!</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/81a68a8cb573c05d.png><h2>Lady Du's early years in the music business</h2><p class=align-left>Growing up with parents who were already in the entertainment business definitely gave Lady Du a headstart. As <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported, Duduzile Ngwenya, <a href=#>aka</a> 'Lady Du', was <a href=# title>born to popular music vet</a>, DJ Choc.</p><p class=align-left>The Gauteng native started pursuing <a href=#>music</a> from an early age, sharing how she'd been working on her career with her father since she was just nine. However, things weren't always that simple for the future popstar, even with all the right connections.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p class=align-left>The late bloomer, who only shot to fame close to her 30th birthday, said that she spent her teenage years working on cruise ships and finally managed to buy her own car at the tender age of 16, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IOL</a></i> reports.</p><p class=align-left>The songstress actually had social media users in an uproar after opening up about having to work a 9-to-5 job to support her music, disclosing that she even worked at Checkers at one point.</p><h2>The daddy-daughter drama</h2><p class=align-left>It seems her dad, DJ Choc, was not at all impressed by the suggestion that he had not stepped up as a father and quickly headed online to share his side of the story. In a fiery Twitter clip, DJ Choc had this to say:</p>“I don't know what Lady Du is talking about when she says she grew up poor. I worked hard and did everything for her in the world. She had everything she needed. She is who she is because of me. Today you see me as a piece of s*** but she can go around telling people she grew up poor,” the musical dad added.<p class=align-left>Soon after, Lady Du spoke with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ThisaLive</a></i> and cleared the air. She said her dad did not have social media so must have heard about her post without any real context. The viral clip was actually sent by DJ Choc to a family member, who says he only wanted to vent his frustrations.</p><p class=align-left>Since then, both dad and daughter have issued public apologies.</p>“My intention wasn't to cause any harm or engage in the social media drama that ensued, my intention was to clarify and shed light on the matter," Choc said.<h2>Lady Du's relationships: Love, amapiano and matching tattoos</h2><p class=align-left>Love and romantic relationships have also been a little tricky for the thriving music mogul. While not much is known about Lady Du's early love affairs, the <i>uZuma Yi Star</i> hitmaker and her new bae, actor Andile Mxakaza, set tongues wagging just a few years back.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZAlebs</a></i>, Lady Du and the former <i>Isibaya </i>actor actually met in their younger days but for some reason, things just didn't work out. Twelve years later the star-crossed lovers met again and it was just four months before they announced their engagement.</p><p class=align-left>The lovebirds were soon married and were serving actual #couplegoals on the timeline. At one point, the celebrity couple even got matching king and queen tattoos on their wrists, which had hearts melting across Mzansi!</p><p class=align-left>Fans were also impressed to see what a good father figure Andile was trying to be for her daughter, Mia, who she'd had in a previous relationship.</p><h2>Lady Du blamed for the very public break-up</h2><p class=align-left>After keeping fans on the edge of their seats for the better part of two years, the once lovey-dovey couple announced their split in January 2022. The public was super shocked - peeps were expecting <a href=#>wedding</a> bells, not a breakup!</p><p class=align-left>As more news about the separation began circulating, South Africans took it upon themselves to dissect the relationship. Many peeps felt Lady Du probably had to dump the sacked<i> Isibaya </i>actor because he could no longer keep up with her glamourous lifestyle.</p><p class=align-left>Some peeps even went after the star, claiming she was making more money than the out-of-work actor and just couldn't handle it.</p><p class=align-left>Still, the former couple has kept things amicable and Andile even went to the musician's defence when she announced her split from her dodgy management team.</p><p class=align-left>So while Lady Du constantly seems to have drama in her life, it looks like peace and reconciliation are not far behind for this music superstar.</p><p class=align-left><strong>New feature:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU </strong>➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKa6056prZmZo7qmutNomp6klZe%2FqsDInqpoaWJthHKFjKWYnbFdmcJussCio56cXaeyra3Toqanq5ievbR5w5qbnbFdmb%2BiucBmnqudp2K6or7RopignaNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mark-francis-vandelli-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-wiki-and-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Francis Vandelli Net Worth: How Rich Is He?
