protect himself from conservative, pro-Second Amendment lawmakers like Representative Madison Cawthorn.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cawthorn said at an event in Macon County, <a href=# id=mol-e2cf6a10-0a53-11ec-8958-c18493341894>North Carolina</a> on Sunday that ‘rigged elections’ will end in ‘bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then on Monday night, Swalwell suggested he fears that Cawthorn could violently lash out in a way that would require him to have a bulletproof vest to protect himself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘A staffer emailed me yesterday asking if I wanted to buy a bulletproof vest because ‘it’s now an approved expense by the House,’ the <a href=# id=mol-e2ce0a80-0a53-11ec-8958-c18493341894>California</a> congressman tweeted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I didn’t believe she was for real,’ Swalwell continued. ‘Turns out she was thinking about people like Cawthorn — NOT even people outside of my office building — BUT inside.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The House now allows lawmakers to expense bulletproof vests if they desire one– an obvious response to the January 6 attack on the Capitol that resulted in five deaths as rioters protested the 2020 presidential election results in the aftermath of a ‘Stop the Steal’ rally.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The congressman’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Swalwell’s tweet.&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-7499d1f70060c209

things that we are wanting to fight for, it doesn’t matter if our votes don’t count,’ Cawthorn told the crowd of around 350-400 people. ‘Because, you know, if our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place — and it’s bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I will tell you, as much as I am willing to defend our liberty at all costs, there is nothing that I would dread doing more than having to pick up arms against a fellow American,’ he added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And the way that we can have recourse against that is if we all passionately demand that we have election security in all 50 states.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Video of Cawthorn’s remarks were posted to the Macon County Republican Party Facebook page.
