But only minimal information about them may be accessed on social media.</p><p>His sons attended the prep school The Heights School in Potomac, Maryland, which was exclusively for boys.</p><p>The school is known for its attentive academic program and emphasis on character development. It offers a well-rounded education to help young men get ready for success in the future.</p><p>On the other side, his children went to Vienna, Virginia’s Oakcrest School for Girls.</p><p>An independent Roman Catholic school with a strong emphasis on academic, spiritual, and personal empowerment for young women is Oakcrest. It provides a supportive environment where girls can mature and hone their skills and morals.</p><p>Opus Dei, a religious organisation that places a strong emphasis on holiness and spiritual development, collaborates with The Heights School and Oakcrest School for Girls.</p><p>These institutions provide a strong foundation in education and character building, seeking to inculcate values and prepare pupils for their future endeavors.</p><p>While attending these institutions, Robert Hanssen’s kids had the chance to get a well-rounded education and integrate into a supportive neighbourhood.</p><p>The personal lives and particular experiences of Robert Hanssen’s children are not frequently discussed in the media or shared on social media.</p><h3>Robert Hanssen dies in prison</h3><p>Robert Hanssen, a well-known former FBI agent engaged in one of the most notorious espionage cases in American history, passed unexpectedly in custody on Monday.</p><p>79-year-old Hanssen was discovered unconscious in his cell at a federal prison in Florence, Colorado, by guards.</p><p>Later, they declared him dead. According to an anonymous source with knowledge of the situation who talked to The Associated Press, Hanssen died from natural causes.</p><p>However, because they lacked permission, they were unable to speak in public about the precise circumstances of Hanssen’s passing.</p><p>Hanssen received a life sentence without the chance of parole beginning in 2002 after pleading guilty to 15 counts of espionage and other crimes.</p><h3>Robert Hanssen involved in Espionage & infamous spy case</h3><p>According to credible reports, Robert Hanssen may have been responsible for the deaths of three Soviet officers who were employed by American intelligence.</p><p>These policemen were murdered after their real identities were revealed.</p><p>Hanssen received a sizable sum of money, including cash, bank funds, diamonds, and pricey Rolex watches, in exchange for divulging top-secret intelligence regarding national security to the Soviet Union and later Russia.</p><p>Despite having received unlawful funds, Hanssen did not lead a lavish life. He and his family of six children lived in a typical house in a peaceful part of Virginia.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t flaunt his money and drove a typical vehicle like a Taurus or a minivan.</p><p>Hanssen later admitted he did it for the money, not because of any views or ideas. However, in a letter he sent to the Soviet Union-based collaborators he was working with in 1985.</p><p>Receiving a sizable payment, he said, could be problematic because it might draw attention and raise suspicions.</p><p>Under the guise of “Ramon Garcia,” Hanssen gave his contacts 26 computer discs and 6,000 classified documents.</p><p>These records helped identify double agents by outlining how to listen in on others’ conversations covertly.</p><p>Hanssen managed to avoid capture for a long time, but investigators eventually named him as their main suspect in the hunt for a Russian spy.</p><p>He was eventually caught when he hid a suitcase of sensitive information beneath a footbridge in a park, where his Russian contacts were supposed to pick them up.</p><p>In 2007, the film “Breach” portrayed Robert Hanssen’s quest for justice and told his narrative. Hanssen was portrayed by actor Chris Cooper in the movie.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="bonnie hanssen obituary,did bonnie hanssen remarry,robert hanssen wife,robert hanssen family,is robert hanssen still married,sue hanssen,is robert hanssen still alive,robert hanssen children,robert hanssen net worth,robert hanssen spy wife" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
