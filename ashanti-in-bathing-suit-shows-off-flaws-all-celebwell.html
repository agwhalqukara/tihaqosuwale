The singer shared a photo of herself to Instagram, showing off her curves in a swimsuit as she lounges next to a pool in the tropics. "Flaws & all," she captioned the stunning image. How does the 41-year-old maintain her impressive physique? Read on to see 10 of Ashanti's top tips for staying in shape and the photos that prove they workâ€”and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Ashanti, who identifies as a pescatarian, makes sure her diet is super clean. She recently explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span> that she majorly overhauled her diet. "I cut out a lot of meat," she said. "I think again, self-health and self-awareness are so important. All of that stuff is so important to maintaining your body, knowing what's in your food, the GMO's and the chemicals, and I'm super aware of this stuff."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ashanti is all about her workouts. "When I'm home in NYC, I have a trainer, Raheem. We do weight training, cardio, running. I'm kind of a tomboy and I'm very competitive so I never want him to beat me. Sometimes he has me work on mobility, other times endurance, and then we'll go for strength. I think it's important to mix it up and hit different parts of your body. We'll do the Stairmaster, lots of core work," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Parents</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ashanti aims for everyday workouts. "I try to get four to five days in a week with my trainer. When I know I'm going for something specific, like preparing for a role, I try to definitely make it five. When I knew I was going down to Trinidad for carnival, for example, we had like two months. So I said, 'Look, I have to be in this little itty bitty costume!' We maybe missed a couple of days but I was really strict with that one," she told Parents.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1346058475.jpg><p><span>Ashanti admits she is "obsessed" with cycling. "I would try to do two classes in a day because I would sweat so much and I loved it!" she told Parents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ashanti notes that "to have balance, you have to eat clean and you have to work out." However, she does stress the importance of indulging, telling People that "you have to allow yourself at least two cheat days so that it doesn't become too strict."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1182832109.jpg><p><span>Ashanti has a major dislike for this exercise, but does it anyway. "I hate burpees! I cannot stand burpees but they are so good for you. And I remember this goes back all the way to middle school gym class where they would call them squat thrusts," she told Parents.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1173016155.jpg><p><span>"I definitely try to do stuff when I'm not with my trainer and he's always paying attention to what I am or am not doing though," she told Parents. "So for instance, I had a cheat day last Saturday morning so I had pancakes and he DMed me and he's like, 'What is that? Are you doing crunches after?' When I'm not at home, he'll text me a workout and I'll try to get it done. I'll try to do crunches and jump rope and pushups and stuff on my own. I try!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1146594502.jpg><p><span>Don't give up until the end, suggests Ashanti. "I don't always feel like working out but finishing a gym session is the best feeling," Ashanti confessed to Parents. "I did that like two weeks ago. I was l so out of it and I was like, 'I don't feel like it.' We were in New York. It was raining. It was gloomy. It was cold. But I pushed myself and I went and I put it on my Insta stories and I'm laying on the floor in the gym and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I was so dead before I got here. And I'm even more tired now but I'm so proud of myself that I actually did the workout.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/shutterstock_1116386318.jpg><p><span>"I'm really into green juices. I'm glad I got one today! I'm actually drinking one now. And I'll make a plant-based protein smoothie to snack on in between as well. I also like the No Cow bars. The raspberry one is the best," Ashanti told Parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1142901365.jpg><p><span>Ashanti does regular colonics. "I'm going to be honest with you. This may be TMI but a great colonic does wonders. Wonders, I promise you," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Black Doctor</span></a><span>. "Colonics and squats and cut out fried foods."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkmquYlru1tYyipWaakam1qrrGZqquoaRiwKm71qxkqJ6WYrOtrdasZJqknGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cammy-babiarz-obituary-lifelong-resident-of-wheaton-illinois-has-passed-away-death-the-worl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cammy Babiarz Obituary, Lifelong Resident Of Wheaton Illinois Has Passed Away  Death  The worl">&larr;
