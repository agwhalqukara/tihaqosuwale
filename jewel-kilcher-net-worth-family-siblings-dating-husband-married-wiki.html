Before the Kilchers were known for their participation in the television series, <strong><a href=#>Alaska: The Last Frontier</a></strong>, Jewel was already out there representing them. In all respects, it is fair to argue that Jewel is a multitalented lady. She is a singer, an actress, a producer, an author, a musician and also a poet. In 2015, Jewel received the Grammy Awards nominations and consequently managed to sell over 30 million copies all over the world.</p><p>Jewel Kilner owes her early success in music to the massive success she received from the father. As a young girl, she could so music together with her dad, Atz Kilcher. This work will dig deeper on the personality of Jewel Kilcher; her net worth, family, relationship status, age and other pieces of personal information.</p><h2><strong>Jewel Kilcher Married To Husband And Divorced? Any Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>The first relationship Jewel involved herself in was with Oscar Sean in 1995. The two had met when Jewel was performing the Late Night Conman. It is from here that Oscar invited Jewel to compose a song for the film he was then working on. The two then dated for a while before finally parting ways. They lasted for three years. After the <strong><a href=#>breakup, Jewel met Ty Murray</a></strong>. She dated Murray for ten years before finally tying the knot in 2008.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4441 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jewel-husband.jpg alt="Image of Jewel Kilcher with her ex-husband Ty Murray" width=600 height=389 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The wedding of the couple took place on the 7th of August, 2008 in the Bahamas. Three years after the wedding, they had a son, Townes Murray. However, on the 14th of April 2014, after about six years of marriage life, Jewel made an announcement in one of the websites that she and Murray were just about to divorce. The news shocked to so many people.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4442 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jewel-ex-husband-kid.jpg alt="Image of Jewel Kilcher with her ex-husband Tu Murray and their kid" width=600 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In spite of their divorce, Jewel still enjoys a very cordial relationship with her former husband. In one of her social media posts, Jewel told the public that she and Murray were determined to provide the best parental environment for their son to grow in. By the time the two were separating, they had known each other for sixteen consecutive years.</p><p>At the moment, Jewel is in a dating relationship with Michael Whitehurst. Charlie is a very successful American footballer. The two met in 2015 and had since then been spotted in several public places, holding hands and helplessly displaying affection in public. Jewel celebrated the 2017 New Year with Charlie. The celebrations were marked with dance and laughter. In one of the interviews, Jewel confirmed the fact that she was dating Charlie.</p><h2><strong>Jewel Kilcher Net Worth, House, Salary</strong></h2><p>The greater portion of Jewelâ€™s wealth can be attributed to the several years of her career as a musician. Most of her fans have come to admit that she is a talented soul with a very beautiful voice. As per the latest estimates are done by Forbes last year, Jewel is said to have an estimated net worth of $30 million. Jewel has a house in San Diego. Her house is tiny and pretty, with a little studio inside it. Besides, she also has a house in Nashville and Telluride. In as much as what the studio Jewel has in the house is a private one, we can still guess that it is a classy one.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4443 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jewel-net-worth.jpg alt="Image of Singer Jewel Kilcher net worth is $30 million" width=600 height=740 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><strong>Jewel Kilcher Family Tree, Father, Mother, Siblings</strong></h2><p>Jewel is the daughter of Lenedra and Atz Kilcher.

She celebrates her birthday on the 23rd of May every year. Throughout the years, Jewel has always had a sense of resentment towards her mother whom she believes abandoned her after the separation with the father. Jewel was born in Utah. The parents divorced when Jewel was only eight years old. Jewel has over the years tried to amend the strained relationship between her and the mother. At some point, Jewel even made her mother the personal manager. Unfortunately, nothing seems to be working between them.</p><h3><strong>What Is Jewel Kilcher Doing Now?</strong></h3><p>For now, Jewel invests most of her time in building her musical career. While not on stage, she prefers to see the son and the newly found boyfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7jIr5yuqJSWwaZ6wqikaKKVrLKtecqio5yglad6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqWt06KloGWYqsCjrc2dZKaZoqe2prCMsKCkoV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shania-twain-celebnetworth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shania Twain - CelebNetWorth">&larr;
