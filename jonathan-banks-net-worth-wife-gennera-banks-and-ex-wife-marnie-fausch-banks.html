If not, then you may know him as Mike Ehrmantraut from an iconic series “Breaking Bad.” The multi-talented actor continues to have a large fan base who are constantly interested in hearing about his personal life. How much does he earn in 2021?</p><p>Now, read this article to glance at some of his individual facts, including some information about his wife, Gennera, and his ex-wife Marnie.</p><h2><strong>Jonathan Banks Net Worth and Income Sources</strong></h2><p>While most people of Jonathan’s age are living a retired life, the actor is still earning a massive sum from his remarkable career. As per<a href=#> celebrity net worth</a>, Banks has gathered a colossal net worth of almost $5 million. The primary source of the actor’s revenue comes from his more than 4-decade long journey in the American entertainment industry. Some of Jonathan’s famous roles include “El Camio: A Breaking Bad Movie.” Also, “Wiseguys,” “Highlander,” “Mudbound,” and “Better Call Saul,” etc.</p><p>So, it can be said the credit for his prosperity and good fortune goes to his incredible acting skills. Moreover, while some people are also eager to find the actor’s monthly revenue, unfortunately, he has kept his salary a mystery. However, an experienced actor like him usually earns about $58 to 71k per month.</p><h2><strong>Jonathan Banks Current Wife, Gennera Banks</strong></h2><p>As of 2021, Mr. Banks is happily married to his beloved wife, Gennera Banks. The couple shared a relationship bond for quite some time before upgrading their dating life into marriage. Jonathan and Gennera exchanged their wedding vows in December of the year 1990, which means they have been happily married for more than three decades.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr. Banks prefers a lowkey lifestyle, and because of this, she has not revealed much of her bio details. However, her husband’s Wikipedia bio states her full name to be Gennera Gonzalez Cebian. In addition, the couple share three children together, two daughters (Joanna Rae Banks Morgan and Rebecca Elena Banks) and a son (Claudio Jon Henry Banks). One of them is Gennera’s daughter from her previous relationship, while the other son and daughter are fraternal twins.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10286 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gennera-Banks-Jonathan-Banks.jpg alt=" Jonathan Banks with his wife, Gennera Banks" width=800 height=533 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-10286 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Banks with his current wife, Gennera Banks</p><h2><strong>Jonathan Banks was Previously Married to Marnie Fausch Banks</strong></h2><p>Mr. Banks initially met Fausch in the 60s when their love was blooming in the air.

Due to some unforeseen situation, their relationship did not last for long, and the celebrities got separated only after two years of being happily married. They legally ended their relationship in 1970.</p><p>The main reason behind their sudden separation is still unknown, and it is believed that they have chosen to keep that information to themselves.
